# START - Project Status

Last updated: 2026-08-02 (Claude Code, autonomous session)

## Repository
- Root: `/Users/lykhn/start`
- Remote: `https://github.com/ELI10k/start.git`
- Second worktree: `/Users/lykhn/start-premium-client-experience` on `codex/start-premium-client-experience`

## Branches
| Branch | Purpose | State |
|---|---|---|
| `main` | canonical | `a3f7cf3` — synced with integration, pushed |
| `integration/start-unified` | working branch | `a3f7cf3` — same commit as main |
| `backup/start-full-state-2026-07-30` | snapshot of the rescued uncommitted work | keep until beta ends |
| `codex/start-premium-client-experience` | the dark/gold redesign source | keep until beta ends |

Production runs `main` @ `a3f7cf3`.

## Baseline validation — all green
| Check | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|
| TypeScript | `npx tsc --noEmit` | pass |
| ESLint | `npm run lint` | pass |
| Tests | `npm test` | **131 / 131** |
| Build | `npm run build` | pass |
| Migration validation | `npm run supabase:migrations:validate` | pass, 42 migrations |

## Environments
- Production: `https://start-snowy-eight.vercel.app`, Vercel team `httpselicohenfitnesscoil`, project `start`.
- Supabase project ref: `bacxfweisncnpjgiqxcp`.
- **Preview and Production still share one Supabase database.** Verified by comparing
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` across both environments. Splitting them needs a second
  Supabase project, which requires account-level access this session does not have.

### Environment variables
| Variable | Production | Preview |
|---|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | yes | yes |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | yes | yes |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | yes | yes |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | yes | **missing** — magic links from Preview resolve to the Production URL |
| `E2E_TEST_LOGIN_ENABLED` | **removed** | `true` |
| `E2E_TEST_EMAILS` | **removed** | **removed — must be re-added for Preview** |

Test-account password login is now off in Production, verified against the live
`/login` markup. To restore it in Preview, re-add `E2E_TEST_EMAILS` with the two
dedicated addresses; find them with:
`select u.email from auth.users u join public.profiles p on p.id = u.id where p.is_test_account;`

## Applied migrations beyond the repo baseline
- `202608020001_curated_master_foods.sql` — applied 2026-08-02 via the Supabase SQL
  editor. 53 curated master foods (28 protein, 18 carbohydrate, 7 fat) from Eli's own
  portion table. Idempotent; rollback at `supabase/seeds/curated-master-foods-rollback.sql`.

## Nutrition engine — current behaviour
- Macro targets: protein 1.8 g/kg, fat 25% of calories, carbohydrate the remainder.
  Grams and percentages both shown; manual override respected; explicit recalculate.
- Calorie target prefills from `client_profiles.calorie_target` on client selection.
- Plan totals count primaries only (`items.slice(0,1)`); free calories are added into
  the daily total on the client screen.
- Alternatives are scaled by `calculateAlternativePortion` — calories weighted 0.9,
  the group macro 0.1 — and marked auto or manual.
- Natural units come from the food source and are rejected for mass and volume units.
  Singular rendering when the quantity is one.
- New menus open with all six fixed meals; untouched meals are dropped on save.
- One-click "3 suggested alternatives" per group, drawn from master foods.
- Meals collapse to a one-line summary.
- Duplicating a plan clears the client, drops to draft and resets macro sources to auto.

## Open items
### Blocked — need something this session cannot obtain
1. **Separate Supabase project for Preview** — needs account-level provisioning.
2. **Payments, subscriptions, App Store** — need Stripe and Apple accounts.
3. **IAP commission structure** — a legal question, explicitly out of scope.
4. **`E2E_TEST_EMAILS`** — the removed value was encrypted and could not be read back.

### Not started
5. Notifications still have no background scheduler. `ensure_in_app_reminders` runs
   only when the notifications page loads — nothing fires while the app is closed.
   No `vercel.json`, no `pg_cron`, no `pg_net`.
6. Workouts, check-ins and photo security have not been re-tested since the merge.
7. Nine of Eli's master foods have no branded catalog equivalent (בטטה, תפוח אדמה,
   אורז לבן, פרכיות and others). The curated master rows cover the coaching use.
8. Self-signup is off — `shouldCreateUser: false`. No free-tier entry path.
9. No product analytics.
10. Client UI redesign is partial: shared shell, tokens and the nutrition screen are
    done; the other client routes still carry the older layout.

## Next recommended task
Time a full five-meal menu build against the two-minute target now that the
skeleton, suggested alternatives and collapse are in. Then the notification
scheduler, which is the single largest functional gap for a consumer product.
